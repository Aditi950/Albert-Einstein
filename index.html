           <b>
                <li>He never failed math. This is a popular "Fact" promoted on the internet, maybe in an attempt to relate to genius. However, it is simply not true. Overall, Eienstein was an average student, but math was one area where he excelled, unsuprisingly.</li>
                <li>Einstein encouraged the development of the nuclear bomb. His involvement is often misinterpreted, with some claming that he helped create the atom bomb. In reality, what he did was write a letter to president FRD encouraging him to begain work on such a weapon, which led to the Manhattan project. Although a dedicated pacifist and, later, an anti-nuke spokesman, Einstein was convinced that America needed the atom bomb before the Nazis.</li>
                <li>He was a great musician. If the whole thing "genius" thing didn't work out, Einstein could have become a violinist. His mother played piano so he had the love of music instiled in him-via violin lessons-at the young age of five.</li>
                <li>He could have been the president of Israel. When Israel's first president, Chaim Weizmann, died, Einsteinwas offerd the position, he declined.</li>
                <li>He married his cousin. After Einstein divorced his first wife, Mileva Maric, he married his cousin, Elso Lowenthal. He was, actually, quite a bad husband to his first wife in their later years. He had affairs he never had to hide, he moved the entire faimly to Berlin without discussion, and treated her more as a servant than a wife.</li>
                <li>He won the 1921 nobel prive for physics. This alone isn't particularly suprising is the fact that he didn't recive for the general or special theory of relativity, but rather for the photoelectric effect.</li>
                <li>He loved to sail. ver since university, Einstein sailed as a Hobby. But by his own admission, he never made a particular good sail. In fact, he didn't even know how to swim.</li>
                <li>He really didn't like socks, and usually didn't wear them. In fact, in a letter to Elsa, he bragged away "without wearing socks" while at Oxfoed.</li>
                <li>He had an illegitimined daughter. This wasn't known untill the 1980s, but according to correspondence between Albert and Mileva it was determined that the two had a daughter in 1902 called Lieserl. At one time, all mention of her in letters stopped so her fate is unknown.</li>
                <li>His brain was stolen. After Einstein died, The pathologist who did his autopsy took his brain without permission. He eventually got the permission from Einstein's son, but he was fired from princeton when he turn the brain over. He kept it over for forty years before finally returning it in 1998.</li>
